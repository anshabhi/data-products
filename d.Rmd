## Introduction

### Old Faithful Geyser Data
   Waiting time between eruptions and the duration of the eruption
     for the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming,
     USA.

   A data frame with 272 observations on 2 variables.

For more details: https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/all-of-statistics/=data/faithful.dat


This application plots a histogram between eruptions and waiting time, with the number of bins as specified by the user.

The app is available at https://anshabhi.shinyapps.io/Shiny/ 

## ui.R
```{}
library(shiny)
# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
shinyUI(fluidPage(
  # Application title
  titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),
  # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel( 
       sliderInput("bins",
                   "Number of bins:",
                   min = 1,
                   max = 50,
                   value = 30)
    ),
    # Show a plot of the generated distribution
    mainPanel(
       plotOutput("distPlot")
    ))))

```

## server.R

```{}
library(shiny)
# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
shinyServer(function(input, output) {
   
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    
    # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
    x    <- faithful[, 2] 
    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
    
    # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
    hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
    
  })
  
})

```
